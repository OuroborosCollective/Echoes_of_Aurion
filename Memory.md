# Memory.md — Echoes of Aurion

> Project-local, append-only integration memory for `OuroborosCollective/Echoes_of_Aurion`.
> Historical bootstrap created 2026-09-09 from retrievable repository/conversation evidence.
> Historical bootstrap only: the former split-owner model is superseded by the Aurion Single Authority reset recorded in the latest entry below.

## Operating contract

1. Read this file before every N+1 integration session.
2. After each completed work block append exactly one entry before merge.
3. Record task, decisions, touched surfaces, tests/evidence, learned result, open points and next safe step.
4. Append-only; corrections are new entries.
5. Aurion is the single owner and truth source for all active gameplay, world, NPC, logic, decisions, databases, persistence, receipts and projections; AX1/WASD are historical provenance only.
6. Runtime claims require exact revision, immutable build/image identity, schema/readback evidence and PatchMon/container health where applicable.
7. Browser/software-renderer evidence is not native GPU/device proof unless a native device was actually measured.
8. No fake snapshots, mock DB state, ad-hoc raw-SQL shortcuts or workflow tricks may stand in for production truth.
9. Secrets never belong in this file.

### 2026-09-07 — Trade/crafting receipt ledger (AIM-233)
Status: VERIFIED repository merge
Task: Add atomic receipt evidence for trade/crafting outcomes.
Decisions: Bind actor, resource deltas, result hash, market/profession context; enforce idempotency, operation/source uniqueness and deterministic hashes.
Touched surfaces: Migration 0037 and receipt persistence.
Evidence: PR #251 merged; head `6bf8f845e635ca7091d2c60fc0402d378236bb04`; 3 focused AIM-233 tests; migration verifier 38 SQL / 38 journal entries.
Learned: Economic effects require deterministic operation identity and replay safety at persistence level.
Open: Runtime use remains separate from schema existence.
Next safe step: Require effect/readback receipts from the exact deployed revision before treating the ledger as product proof.

### 2026-09-07 — Chunk-delta conflict persistence (AIM-234)
Status: VERIFIED repository merge
Task: Persist deterministic chunk-delta paging conflicts.
Decisions: Bind deltas to base revision, use stable paging, deterministic lowest-hash conflict winner, scope validation and idempotent persistence.
Touched surfaces: Migration 0038 and world-chunk evidence.
Evidence: PR #253 merged; head `62fb3a5b8117815e8c58049559ce555879015a2d`; 11 focused tests; 39 SQL / 39 journal entries verified.
Learned: Conflict resolution is truth-bearing and therefore must be deterministic and revision-bound.
Open: Consumer/runtime behavior still requires separate live evidence.
Next safe step: Preserve source revision and conflict receipt through every projection.

### 2026-09-07 — Presence epoch materialization (AIM-235)
Status: VERIFIED repository merge
Task: Persist receipt-bound presence epoch materializations.
Decisions: Bind world epoch, resolution index, reaction receipt/hash and deterministic presence digest; enforce replay and epoch-boundary validation.
Touched surfaces: Migration 0039.
Evidence: PR #254 merged; head `0915f7f21f2b9de3163f09f8a6eb5eb11ee67869`; 11 presence/epoch tests; 40 SQL / 40 journal entries verified.
Learned: Presence becomes durable only when epoch and causal receipt are part of identity.
Open: None beyond runtime use/readback.
Next safe step: Do not reconstruct presence from unbound UI state.

### 2026-09-07 — Consolidated progression receipts (AIM-236)
Status: VERIFIED repository merge
Task: Create canonical progression receipts across loot, mastery, XP and levels.
Decisions: Bind user/character/action/weapon-or-skill/result/loot/mastery/XP/level evidence with deterministic hashes and idempotent replay protection.
Touched surfaces: Migration 0040.
Evidence: PR #255 merged; head `1758fde377cbffc55c6de2488b445f740d32dacb`; 12 focused tests; 41 SQL / 41 journal entries verified.
Learned: Progression truth must be reconstructable from confirmed receipts, not class/name heuristics.
Open: UI readback remained a separate later integration.
Next safe step: Derive presentation only from confirmed progression receipts.

### 2026-09-07 — Append-only content-hash migration ledger (AIM-237)
Status: VERIFIED repository merge
Task: Add content-hash ledger and redacted audit receipts to the migration chain.
Decisions: Enforce append-only triggers and root-only audit evidence; classify readback as `VERIFIED`, `DRIFT` or `UNREADABLE` rather than assuming absence.
Touched surfaces: Migration 0041, migration readback classification.
Evidence: PR #256 merged; head `39f11ca0844e1f2733584c562506e3fd99b0e24b`; 8 focused tests; 42 SQL / 42 journal entries verified.
Learned: Hidden/redacted database metadata must fail closed as unreadable, not be mistaken for an older schema.
Open: Production reconciliation had to be brought through 0041 later.
Next safe step: Keep planning/apply/readback coverage aligned to the full journal.

### 2026-09-07 — Visual Item authority boundary (AIM-281)
Status: VERIFIED repository merge
Task: Define a strict presentation-only `VisualItemDescriptor` from already-confirmed Loot V2.
Decisions: Bind `visualSeed` to deterministic loot hash + receipt + visual event index; omit gameplay stats/power; reject malformed or mismatched identities.
Touched surfaces: Shared visual contract and projection tests.
Evidence: PR #257 merged; head `c1cdab14d3b88bb9a1953569a55c2e1dff2fd63b`.
Learned: Visual generation may be deterministic without becoming gameplay authority.
Open: Geometry/material/GLB/runtime integration followed in later slices.
Next safe step: Keep every visual stage downstream of the same confirmed descriptor.

### 2026-09-07 — Deterministic visual geometry compiler (AIM-282)
Status: VERIFIED repository merge
Task: Compile presentation-only Three.js geometry for weapon/armor families across LOD0/1/2.
Decisions: Use only `VisualItemDescriptor`; measure real triangle counts; deterministic structural fingerprints; reject unsupported categories rather than fake fallback identities.
Touched surfaces: Visual geometry compiler and disposal/LOD tests.
Evidence: PR #268 merged; head `01f996e6bed172fd9982696cb9d497cc40b17c4a`.

### 2026-09-30 — Visual Construction Runtime Cache (AIM-525)
Status: VERIFIED candidate integration; merge pending
Task: Add bounded runtime-only caching for canonical visual construction without introducing a new truth source.
Change: Added a 128-entry LRU for immutable morphology recipes; cache key is descriptorHash + grammarVersion + avatarProfileVersion + fitVersion + lod; cache is injected into morphology/geometry/source resolution, used by the live attachment controller, and cleared on dispose.
Evidence: Exact candidate head `c6ce51c7ab9c2b27cebf03d23557efa1f15efc2d`; AIM-525 focused workflow `36760894530` passed 7 test files / 44 tests, `pnpm check`, and `pnpm build`; Aurion Local Test Pack `36760894397` passed; Aurion PR Runtime Container Proof `36760894684` passed. Aurion PR Runtime Candidate `36760894342` still reports the pre-existing `RETURN_STONE_LIVE_CATALOG_MISSING` live-catalog blocker and is not treated as cache evidence.
Learned: A cache is semantically safe when it stores reconstructible presentation recipes rather than gameplay state or GPU snapshots, making eviction, restart, and rebuild identity-neutral.
Open: Merge PR #704.
Next safe step: Merge the green PR and then continue with the next unsatisfied architecture slice.

### 2026-10-01 — Aurion inventory transaction kernel (AIM-502)
Status: VERIFIED candidate, merge-ready
Task: Integrate the supplied Issue #502 package into the existing Aurion item/equipment authority with deterministic Item/Inventory/Equipment transaction semantics.
Decisions: Keep Aurion as sole gameplay/world truth; adapt the ZIP semantics into existing legacy `itemInstances` and `aurionItemInstancesV2` plus append-only `aurionInventoryReceipts`; no parallel gameplay-state tables. Enforce exact quantity/revision handling, deterministic stack identity/order/state hashing, owner serialization, optimistic revision/state guards, replay-safe idempotency and fail-closed conflicting retries.
Touched surfaces: `server/aurionInventoryTransactionProtocol.ts`, `server/aurionInventoryStackIdentity.ts`, `server/aurionInventoryBackendAdapter.ts`, MariaDB/pure regression tests, `server/db.ts`, UI projection/persistence, `server/routers.ts`, `drizzle/schema.ts`, migration `0066_aurion_inventory_transaction_kernel.sql`, migration journal/production reconciliation contracts and affected CI proofs.
Evidence: Final exact PR head `9e98a4651b336d14b2104344c7ef27c2767f92e3`; 30/30 GitHub checks green, including deterministic contract, real MariaDB transaction/readback, rollback/replay, isolated UI/equipment, GLB/runtime/build, exact-head runtime, reconciliation, backup/recovery/apply, evidence and GDS proofs. Migration chain: 67 SQL / 67 journal entries, no unjournaled tags, duplicate prefixes/tags, trailing breakpoints or empty statement segments.
Learned: Drizzle MySQL migrations must not end with a trailing `statement-breakpoint`; the migration-chain verifier now rejects both trailing and empty segments. Production schema reconciliation must include legacy `playerProfiles` when late migrations extend that table. Historical 0065 watermarks and proof assertions must advance coherently when 0066 is introduced.
Open: PR #718 merge/readback only; no new implementation blocker remains on the candidate head.
Next safe step: Merge PR #718 and verify the resulting `main` head plus closed Issue #502.

### 2026-10-02 — Atomic crafting and item manipulation runtime (AIM-535)
Status: VERIFIED isolated MariaDB effects; final candidate CI pending
Task: Complete all eight manipulations through Aurion's existing inventory, item and crafting receipt authority.
Decisions: Share Loot V2 affix rules; serialize owner transactions; bind recipe, materials, tools/mastery and exact state guards; expose confirmed receipts through the workbench and equipment readback.
Evidence: PR #726; exact initial candidate `94ac5df0bfb2fc189eeb45c12c4f52445c89f732`, workflow `36990383331`: all eight operations plus concurrent replay, insufficient/foreign input rejection and real database rollback passed; existing inventory/legacy crafting tests passed. Migration 0068 extends existing tables.
Learned: Migration-wave artifact lists and isolated UI database names must advance together; crafting replay hashes must normalize persisted JSON dates.
Open: Final exact-head HTTP, full regression and merge/main readback.
Next safe step: Require final candidate evidence, merge PR #726 and verify Issue #535 closure.


### 2026-10-02 — PR #727 — fix: restore post-merge Memory recorder regression
Status: VERIFIED repository merge
<!-- auto-memory: pr=727 merge=8b8da44b2b8870ed18241671b40fa6a8f090ab9b -->
Task: Merge PR #727 into `main` — fix: restore post-merge Memory recorder regression.
Decisions: The merge was accepted through the repository's configured PR gates; Aurion remains the sole active gameplay/world/persistence authority.
Touched surfaces:
- `.github/workflows/agent-memory-supabase-sync.yml`
- `scripts/append-post-merge-memory.test.mjs`
Evidence:
- Pull request: https://github.com/OuroborosCollective/Echoes_of_Aurion/pull/727
- Merge commit: `8b8da44b2b8870ed18241671b40fa6a8f090ab9b`

- Merged at: 2026-10-02T11:31:13Z
- Post-merge workflow run: 37001457260
Learned: Post-merge automation must receive the same syntax and contract coverage before merge; testing only the mirror sync allowed a broken recorder test to remain unnoticed.  Follow-up to #535 and #726; gameplay and migration contents remain the verified #726 merge tree.
Open: Runtime, deployment and independent readback claims remain governed by their respective evidence lanes; this entry records the repository merge only.
Next safe step: Use the new main revision as the canonical baseline for the next integration and require independent runtime/readback evidence where applicable.


### 2026-10-02 — PR #726 — feat: complete AIM-535 atomic crafting and item manipulation
Status: VERIFIED repository merge

- Post-merge workflow run: 37000532936
Learned: Deterministic item rolls must commit to the paid material allocation, while retry keys remain transport metadata. Canonical aggregation preserves the same cause when identical materials are split. Receipts and confirmed UI readbacks must expose every consumed identity and persisted effect; recipe membership order and migration-wave bounds must remain canonical across neighboring proofs.  Memory.md records change, insight and verified isolated effects; automated post-merge recording will bind the merge and final head. [GitBook preview](https://ouroboroscollective.gitbook.io/ouroboroscollective-docs/~/revisions/89QgYhx4HK7VM7HqxfOe/).  Fixes #535.  NPC neighbor CI exposed a pre-existing synchronous identity remap cycle in the canonical Aurion semantic graph: identical node evidence registered an ID-to-itself mapping. Only changed IDs are now remapped. A bounded fresh-process regression reproduces the previous timeout and proves deterministic graph compilation with valid edge endpoints after the fix. The original MariaDB NPC and container gates passed at this final head.
Open: Runtime, deployment and independent readback claims remain governed by their respective evidence lanes; this entry records the repository merge only.
Next safe step: Use the new main revision as the canonical baseline for the next integration and require independent runtime/readback evidence where applicable.

### 2026-10-03 — Service-cell generator operational clock boundary
Status: VERIFIED repository regression
Task: Correct the Aurion service-cell template so newly generated TypeScript is typed and does not embed direct wall-clock access.
Decisions: Keep operational time outside deterministic gameplay truth by importing the existing `hostOperationalClock`; type the generated effect, readback and observability boundaries with the canonical pipeline contracts rather than implicit `any` parameters.
Touched surfaces: `server/aurionServiceCellGenerator.ts`, `server/aurionServiceCell.test.ts`.
Evidence: `pnpm vitest run server/aurionServiceCell.test.ts` passed 33 tests; `pnpm check` passed; `pnpm test` passed 376 files / 1,827 tests with 55 files / 207 environment-dependent tests skipped. The focused regression reads back the generated source and verifies the operational-clock import, typed contracts and absence of `Date.now(`.
Learned: The hardened generator itself must obey the boundary it advertises; a comment instructing future callers to replace direct wall time leaves every generated cell unsafe-by-default and strict-TypeScript-incomplete.
Open: No runtime/deployment claim is made; this generator-only change has no persistent or effectful runtime path.
Next safe step: Keep future service-cell templates bound to shared Aurion contracts and verify emitted source invariants in the generator regression suite.


### 2026-10-03 — PR #732 — fix: harden generated service-cell clock boundary
Status: VERIFIED repository merge
<!-- auto-memory: pr=732 merge=e316ea13a854925a6a6ba5cf400cf75f7ed8eb1a -->
Task: Merge PR #732 into `main` — fix: harden generated service-cell clock boundary.
Decisions: The merge was accepted through the repository's configured PR gates; Aurion remains the sole active gameplay/world/persistence authority.
Touched surfaces:
- `Memory.md`
- `server/aurionServiceCell.test.ts`
- `server/aurionServiceCellGenerator.ts`
Evidence:
- Pull request: https://github.com/OuroborosCollective/Echoes_of_Aurion/pull/732

- Merged at: 2026-10-03T00:55:10Z
- Post-merge workflow run: 37084044077
Learned: Repository memory is now recorded automatically from the completed merge instead of requiring a manual post-merge Memory.md edit.
Open: Runtime, deployment and independent readback claims remain governed by their respective evidence lanes; this entry records the repository merge only.
Next safe step: Use the new main revision as the canonical baseline for the next integration and require independent runtime/readback evidence where applicable.


### 2026-10-03 — PR #730: Cinder Vault route survives quest progression
Status: VERIFIED regression and isolated MariaDB readback
Task: Preserve the confirmed dungeon gate in the world snapshot after Ember Key turn-in.
Decisions: Project one locked Emberfall gate or one available route after canonical access; preserve zone/encounter selection and authorization; remove unrelated BVH receipt churn.
Touched surfaces: openWorldProtocol, snapshot/quest-chain regressions, source-bound AIM-265 receipt.
Evidence: Candidate `439be44bc70167768a57e16bc1136cc39f9270c1`; four new cases failed before the fix; 32 focused tests, TypeScript and full local regression passed (376 files / 1,831 tests; 207 environment-dependent tests skipped). Exact-head MariaDB workflow https://github.com/OuroborosCollective/Echoes_of_Aurion/actions/runs/37085340580 passed the real quest turn-in, denied pre-key encounter and independent locked/unlocked world readbacks; balancing replay also passed.
Learned: The unlocked Emberfall-only branch was unreachable because progression selected another zone; assert the returned snapshot across the transition.
Open: Final Memory-inclusive CI and merge/main readback; no production deployment claim.
Next safe step: Merge only the verified final head and verify automated post-merge Memory/readback.


### 2026-10-03 — PR #730 — fix: preserve confirmed Cinder Vault access across quest zones
Status: VERIFIED repository merge
<!-- auto-memory: pr=730 merge=4d064a3d3f4da3dffb875e43222e9304609f7046 -->
Task: Merge PR #730 into `main` — fix: preserve confirmed Cinder Vault access across quest zones.
Decisions: Aurion remains the sole gameplay and persistence authority. This is a display projection fix; no new teleport command, reward rule or client-side authorization is introduced.
Touched surfaces:
- `Memory.md`
- `docs/balancing/aim265-candidate.json`
- `server/openWorldProtocol.test.ts`
- `server/openWorldProtocol.ts`
- `server/questChainRegression.e2e.test.ts`
Evidence:
- Pull request: https://github.com/OuroborosCollective/Echoes_of_Aurion/pull/730
- Merge commit: `4d064a3d3f4da3dffb875e43222e9304609f7046`

- Merged at: 2026-10-03T01:24:44Z
- Post-merge workflow run: 37085989979
Learned: An unlock projection must be asserted in the zone actually returned after progression, not only in a zone-local table that stops being selected.
Open: No implementation blocker remains. Verify the merged main head and automated post-merge memory readback. Isolated candidate proof does not claim production deployment.
Next safe step: Use the new main revision as the canonical baseline for the next integration and require independent runtime/readback evidence where applicable.


### 2026-10-03 — PR #733: In-game GLB catalog and mobile movement placement
Status: VERIFIED component regression and isolated MariaDB/browser readback
Task: Restore direct admin-imported GLB assets in the in-game catalog and anchor movement controls at the lower left.
Decisions: Read the protected admin asset registry; distinguish loading, failure and confirmed empty results; retain server authorization. Remove the HUD-wide positioning override and reserve mobile touch space.
Evidence: Candidate `ff058cf088553c9475c0cc0e77d188723348fa4b`; four catalog cases failed before the fix. TypeScript and full local regression passed (377 files / 1,836 tests; 207 environment-dependent tests skipped). Isolated authenticated upload, persisted asset readback, catalog selection and joystick geometry at 412×732, 800×1280 and 932×430 passed: https://github.com/OuroborosCollective/Echoes_of_Aurion/actions/runs/37086914153. Live read-only comparison found 78 registered runtime assets but no public community submissions.
Learned: Public community submissions are not the admin asset registry; a broad relative-position rule can silently override HUD anchors. The neighboring phone regression additionally caught a four-pixel action-panel overlap from an older important offset; remove that override and measure the whole action panel.
Open: Final Memory-inclusive CI and merge readback; inventory warnings and production deployment are not covered by this fix.
Next safe step: Merge the verified final head and verify automated post-merge Memory/readback.
