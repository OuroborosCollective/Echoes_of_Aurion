# Memory.md — Echoes of Aurion

> Project-local, append-only integration memory for `OuroborosCollective/Echoes_of_Aurion`.
> Historical bootstrap created 2026-09-09 from retrievable repository/conversation evidence.
> Historical bootstrap only: the former split-owner model is superseded by the Aurion Single Authority reset recorded in the latest entry below.

## Operating contract

1. Read this file before every N+1 integration session.
2. After each completed work block append exactly one entry before merge.
3. Record task, decisions, touched surfaces, tests/evidence, learned result, open points and next safe step.
4. Append-only; corrections are new entries.
5. Aurion is the single owner and truth source for all active gameplay, world, NPC, logic, decisions, databases, persistence, receipts and projections; AX1/WASD are historical provenance only.
6. Runtime claims require exact revision, immutable build/image identity, schema/readback evidence and PatchMon/container health where applicable.
7. Browser/software-renderer evidence is not native GPU/device proof unless a native device was actually measured.
8. No fake snapshots, mock DB state, ad-hoc raw-SQL shortcuts or workflow tricks may stand in for production truth.
9. Secrets never belong in this file.

### 2026-09-07 — Trade/crafting receipt ledger (AIM-233)
Status: VERIFIED repository merge
Task: Add atomic receipt evidence for trade/crafting outcomes.
Decisions: Bind actor, resource deltas, result hash, market/profession context; enforce idempotency, operation/source uniqueness and deterministic hashes.
Touched surfaces: Migration 0037 and receipt persistence.
Evidence: PR #251 merged; head `6bf8f845e635ca7091d2c60fc0402d378236bb04`; 3 focused AIM-233 tests; migration verifier 38 SQL / 38 journal entries.
Learned: Economic effects require deterministic operation identity and replay safety at persistence level.
Open: Runtime use remains separate from schema existence.
Next safe step: Require effect/readback receipts from the exact deployed revision before treating the ledger as product proof.

### 2026-09-07 — Chunk-delta conflict persistence (AIM-234)
Status: VERIFIED repository merge
Task: Persist deterministic chunk-delta paging conflicts.
Decisions: Bind deltas to base revision, use stable paging, deterministic lowest-hash conflict winner, scope validation and idempotent persistence.
Touched surfaces: Migration 0038 and world-chunk evidence.
Evidence: PR #253 merged; head `62fb3a5b8117815e8c58049559ce555879015a2d`; 11 focused tests; 39 SQL / 39 journal entries verified.
Learned: Conflict resolution is truth-bearing and therefore must be deterministic and revision-bound.
Open: Consumer/runtime behavior still requires separate live evidence.
Next safe step: Preserve source revision and conflict receipt through every projection.

### 2026-09-07 — Presence epoch materialization (AIM-235)
Status: VERIFIED repository merge
Task: Persist receipt-bound presence epoch materializations.
Decisions: Bind world epoch, resolution index, reaction receipt/hash and deterministic presence digest; enforce replay and epoch-boundary validation.
Touched surfaces: Migration 0039.
Evidence: PR #254 merged; head `0915f7f21f2b9de3163f09f8a6eb5eb11ee67869`; 11 presence/epoch tests; 40 SQL / 40 journal entries verified.
Learned: Presence becomes durable only when epoch and causal receipt are part of identity.
Open: None beyond runtime use/readback.
Next safe step: Do not reconstruct presence from unbound UI state.

### 2026-09-07 — Consolidated progression receipts (AIM-236)
Status: VERIFIED repository merge
Task: Create canonical progression receipts across loot, mastery, XP and levels.
Decisions: Bind user/character/action/weapon-or-skill/result/loot/mastery/XP/level evidence with deterministic hashes and idempotent replay protection.
Touched surfaces: Migration 0040.
Evidence: PR #255 merged; head `1758fde377cbffc55c6de2488b445f740d32dacb`; 12 focused tests; 41 SQL / 41 journal entries verified.
Learned: Progression truth must be reconstructable from confirmed receipts, not class/name heuristics.
Open: UI readback remained a separate later integration.
Next safe step: Derive presentation only from confirmed progression receipts.

### 2026-09-07 — Append-only content-hash migration ledger (AIM-237)
Status: VERIFIED repository merge
Task: Add content-hash ledger and redacted audit receipts to the migration chain.
Decisions: Enforce append-only triggers and root-only audit evidence; classify readback as `VERIFIED`, `DRIFT` or `UNREADABLE` rather than assuming absence.
Touched surfaces: Migration 0041, migration readback classification.
Evidence: PR #256 merged; head `39f11ca0844e1f2733584c562506e3fd99b0e24b`; 8 focused tests; 42 SQL / 42 journal entries verified.
Learned: Hidden/redacted database metadata must fail closed as unreadable, not be mistaken for an older schema.
Open: Production reconciliation had to be brought through 0041 later.
Next safe step: Keep planning/apply/readback coverage aligned to the full journal.

### 2026-09-07 — Visual Item authority boundary (AIM-281)
Status: VERIFIED repository merge
Task: Define a strict presentation-only `VisualItemDescriptor` from already-confirmed Loot V2.
Decisions: Bind `visualSeed` to deterministic loot hash + receipt + visual event index; omit gameplay stats/power; reject malformed or mismatched identities.
Touched surfaces: Shared visual contract and projection tests.
Evidence: PR #257 merged; head `c1cdab14d3b88bb9a1953569a55c2e1dff2fd63b`.
Learned: Visual generation may be deterministic without becoming gameplay authority.
Open: Geometry/material/GLB/runtime integration followed in later slices.
Next safe step: Keep every visual stage downstream of the same confirmed descriptor.

### 2026-09-07 — Deterministic visual geometry compiler (AIM-282)
Status: VERIFIED repository merge
Task: Compile presentation-only Three.js geometry for weapon/armor families across LOD0/1/2.
Decisions: Use only `VisualItemDescriptor`; measure real triangle counts; deterministic structural fingerprints; reject unsupported categories rather than fake fallback identities.
Touched surfaces: Visual geometry compiler and disposal/LOD tests.
Evidence: PR #268 merged; head `01f996e6bed172fd9982696cb9d497cc40b17c4a`.

### 2026-09-30 — Visual Construction Runtime Cache (AIM-525)
Status: VERIFIED candidate integration; merge pending
Task: Add bounded runtime-only caching for canonical visual construction without introducing a new truth source.
Change: Added a 128-entry LRU for immutable morphology recipes; cache key is descriptorHash + grammarVersion + avatarProfileVersion + fitVersion + lod; cache is injected into morphology/geometry/source resolution, used by the live attachment controller, and cleared on dispose.
Evidence: Exact candidate head `c6ce51c7ab9c2b27cebf03d23557efa1f15efc2d`; AIM-525 focused workflow `36760894530` passed 7 test files / 44 tests, `pnpm check`, and `pnpm build`; Aurion Local Test Pack `36760894397` passed; Aurion PR Runtime Container Proof `36760894684` passed. Aurion PR Runtime Candidate `36760894342` still reports the pre-existing `RETURN_STONE_LIVE_CATALOG_MISSING` live-catalog blocker and is not treated as cache evidence.
Learned: A cache is semantically safe when it stores reconstructible presentation recipes rather than gameplay state or GPU snapshots, making eviction, restart, and rebuild identity-neutral.
Open: Merge PR #704.
Next safe step: Merge the green PR and then continue with the next unsatisfied architecture slice.
